# ursa-ts-mode

© 2023 Reuben Thomas  

An Emacs mode for the [Ursa programming language](https://ursalang.github.io).
This mode requires tree-sitter, which is built into Emacs 29 or later.

The package is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3,
or (at your option) any later version. It was adapted from json-ts-mode by
Theodor Thornhill, from Emacs 29.1.

You can install ursa-ts-mode from [MELPA](https://melpa.org).

Having installed the mode, run `M-x treesit-install-language-grammar RET`
and choose `ursa` to install the tree-sitter grammar.
